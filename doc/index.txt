Atalan
******

Atalan is new high level experimental programming language for system programming.
It is meant to be used for development on 8bit computers like Atari 800,
C64, ZX Spectrum and other small (embedded) systems etc. 

Compiler is rule driven and extremely retargettable. It is very easy to add
support for new platform and it is possible to provide support for new CPU
without touching the compiler source code. Programmers can easily provide support
for new data types or operators.

Atalan is cross-platform development system. Compiler runs on desktop machine
(Windows, Linux, OSX - it is developed just using ANSI C, so porting to other 
systems should be straightforward).

Warning!

When I say Atalan is a work in progress, I mean it. There are bugs, features
may go missing or appear erratically, semantics may evolve. I shape the Atalan according to my needs
and ideas about ideal (or at least good) programming language. Some of the Atalan
features are highly experimental (for example type inferencer or rule driven translation). 

If you are looking for a stable development tool and have no desire to be involved
in the development of the programming language, you have to look somewhere else.
If you feel adventurous, you are most welcome to come and play with Atalan.

Language Features
=================

- structured programming (if then else, while, until)
- powerful loop construct (for k where sieve(k) = 1 until KEY = Q)
- enumerations
- procedures
- nested procedures
- functions with multiple return values
- macros
- numeric types defined using range (min..max)
- variables may be stored in user defined place
- blocks defined by parentheses, indent or one line
- local scope rules for constants
- type associated constants  (type hour:0..23 (noon = 12 midnight = 0))
- multidimensional arrays
- support for interrupts
- chained relational operators (10 < x <= 100)
- parametrized modules 
- type inferencing
- possibility to call assembler routines including definition of register arguments
