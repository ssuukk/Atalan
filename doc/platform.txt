How to define your own platform
*******************************

To create new platform for Atalan, it is necessary to create platform module.

Platform module for platform named XXX is stored in file
:::::::::::::::: 
%SYSTEM%/platform/XXX/XXX.atl
::::::::::::::::
directory.

==============
Print routines
==============

Processor file defines routines for printing.
If a platform supports text output (not all do), it should define character
printing routine.

The routine must be named _out_putchr and print ASCII character specified in 
register A.

Platform must also specify routine _adr_putchr with same interface.
This routine should store the character specified in A to address specified
by variable _arr.

This is default implementation.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
_adr_putchr .proc
;Write byte to address specified by _arr and increment the address by 1.
		 	
	ldy #0
	sta (_arr),y

	inc _arr
	bne skip1
	inc _arr+1
skip1
	rts
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

As this is commonly used to output to memory mapped screen, this routine may need
to perform some conversion of character encoding.
(This is for example done on Atari platform.)
