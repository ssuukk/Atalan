Assignment variants

name : type = value


name:0..30 = 13  -- define variable with range 0..30, initial value 13

name:0..30  -- declare variable with specified type (number in the range 0..30)

name: 13    -- defines constant (variable with possible value range 13..13)

name = 13   -- set the value of variable to 13

name := 30  -- declare new variable without specifying it's type, assign it initial value of 30

name: x * 30  -- the value is not known at compile time, it is not possible to assign different value to it later

name = 0..30  -- name contains value of range type
