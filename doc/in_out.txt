Different types of hardware registers

in		Input register. It is only possible to read the value.
      Any attempt to modify it will be reported as errro.
      The value may change independently from the application, so it may not
      be cached.
      An example is state of joystick button.
      
out   Output only register. It may not be read. Writing to it will somehow
      modify the state of the system, so it may not be removed by optimizer.
      An example may be register defining the color of background.


in sequence  Input register with side-effect. Reading it has some kind of side effect
      (like you are reading a sequence of bytes from some buffer, where each read
			 returns next byte).
			 Optimizer will never remove reading of the register, even if the value red
			 is not used anyhow.

in out  Output register, whose value may be read back. The value written into
       The register will be read back, until the applicaton changes it.
       Read of the register may be cached, writes must be presved though.


It is possible to create two registers for the same address. 
One will be used for writing, another for reading.
In such case, they are considered completely different registers.
