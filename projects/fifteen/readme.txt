Not so simple Atalan game.
But the development was really fast: 4 days with graphics and music.
Well, SuperFortuna took 2 months...
Greetings 4 All, especially 4 Rudolf Kudla, author of Atalan.

There is very tight memory gap between end of code and addres $93e0,
which is used by the RMT player.
The code is compiled with optimizations off, because of some bugs in optimizer.
